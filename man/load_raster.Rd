\title{Load eBird Status Data Products raster data}
\usage{
load_raster(
  species,
  product = c("abundance", "count", "occurrence", "proportion-population"),
  period = c("weekly", "seasonal", "full-year"),
  metric = NULL,
  resolution = c("3km", "9km", "27km"),
  path = ebirdst_data_dir()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{character; the species to load data for, given as a scientific
name, common name or six-letter species code (e.g. "woothr"). The full list
of valid species is in the \link{ebirdst_runs} data frame included in this
package. To download the example dataset, use \code{"yebsap-example"}.}

\item{product}{character; eBird Status raster product to load: occurrence,
count, relative abundance, or proportion of population. See Details for a
detailed explanation of each of these products.}

\item{period}{character; temporal period of the estimation. The eBird Status
models make predictions for each week of the year; however, as a
convenience, data are also provided summarized at the seasonal or annual
("full-year") level.}

\item{metric}{character; by default, the weekly products provide estimates of
the median value (\code{metric = "median"}) and the summarized products are the
cell-wise mean across the weeks within the season (\code{metric = "mean"}).
However, additional variants exist for some of the products. For the weekly
relative abundance, confidence intervals are provided: specify \code{metric = "lower"} to get the 10th quantile or \code{metric = "upper"} to get the 90th
quantile. For the seasonal and annual products, the cell-wise maximum
values across weeks can be obtained with \code{metric = "max"}.}

\item{resolution}{character; the resolution of the raster data to load. The
default is to load the native 3 km resolution data; however, for some
applications 9 km or 27 km data may be suitable.}

\item{path}{character; directory to download the data to. All downloaded
files will be placed in a sub-directory of this directory named for the
data version year, e.g. "2020" for the 2020 Status Data Products. Each
species' data package will then appear in a directory named with the eBird
species code. Defaults to a persistent data directory, which can be found
by calling \code{ebirdst_data_dir()}.}
}
\value{
For the weekly cubes, a \link[terra:SpatRaster-class]{SpatRaster} with 52
layers for the given product, where the layer names are the dates
(\code{YYYY-MM-DD} format) of the midpoint of each week. Seasonal cubes will
have up to four layers named with the corresponding season. The full-year
products will have a single layer.
}
\description{
Each of the eBird Status raster products is packaged as a GeoTIFF file
representing predictions on a regular grid. The core products are occurrence,
count, relative abundance, and proportion of population. This function loads
one of the available data products into R as a
\link[terra:SpatRaster-class]{SpatRaster} object. Note that data must be downloaded
using \code{\link[=ebirdst_download_status]{ebirdst_download_status()}} prior to loading it using this function.
}
\details{
The core eBird Status data products provide weekly estimates across
a regular spatial grid. They are packaged as rasters with 52 layers, each
corresponding to estimates for a week of the year, and we refer to them as
"cubes" (e.g. the "relative abundance cube"). All estimates are the median
expected value for a standard 2 km, 1 hour eBird Traveling Count by an
expert eBird observer at the optimal time of day and for optimal weather
conditions to observe the given species. These products are:
\itemize{
\item \code{occurrence}: the expected probability (0-1) of occurrence of a species.
\item \code{count}: the expected count of a species, conditional on its occurrence at
the given location.
\item \code{abundance}: the expected relative abundance of a species, computed as the
product of the probability of occurrence and the count conditional on
occurrence.
\item \code{proportion-population}: the proportion of the total relative abundance
within each cell. This is a derived product calculated by dividing each cell
value in the relative abundance raster by the total abundance summed across
all cells.
}

In addition to these weekly data cubes, this function provides access to data
summarized over different periods. Seasonal cubes are produced by taking the
cell-wise mean or max across the weeks within each season. The boundary dates
for each season are species specific and are available in \code{ebirdst_runs}, and
if a season failed review no associated layer will be included in the cube.
In addition, full-year summaries provide the mean or max across all weeks of
the year that fall within a season that passed review. Note that this is not
necessarily all 52 weeks of the year. For example, if the estimates for the
non-breeding season failed expert review for a given species, the full-year
summary for that species will not include the weeks that would fall within
the non-breeding season.
