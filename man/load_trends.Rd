\title{Load eBird Trends estimates for a set of species}
\usage{
load_trends(species, fold_estimates = FALSE, path = ebirdst_data_dir())
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{character; one or more species given as scientific names,
common names or six-letter species codes (e.g. "woothr"). The full list of
valid species can be viewed in the \link{ebirdst_runs} data frame included in
this package; species with trends estimates are indicated by the
\code{has_trends} column. To access the example dataset, use "yebsap-example".}

\item{fold_estimates}{logical; by default, the trends summarized across the
100-fold ensemble are returned; however, by setting \code{fold_estimates = TRUE}
the individual fold-level estimates are returned.}

\item{path}{character; directory to download the data to. All downloaded
files will be placed in a sub-directory of this directory named for the
data version year, e.g. "2020" for the 2020 Status Data Products. Each
species' data package will then appear in a directory named with the eBird
species code. Defaults to a persistent data directory, which can be found
by calling \code{ebirdst_data_dir()}.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the trends estimates for a set of species.
The following columns are included:
\itemize{
\item \code{species_code}: the alphanumeric eBird species code uniquely identifying
the species.
\item \code{season}:  season that the trend was estimated for: breeding,
nonbreeding, or resident.
\item \code{start_year/end_year}: the start and end years of the trend time period.
\item \code{start_date/end_date}: the start and end dates (\code{MM-DD} format) of the
season for which the trend was estimated.
\item \code{srd_id}: unique integer identifier for the grid cell.
\item \code{longitude/latitude}: longitude and latitude of the grid cell center.
\item \code{abd}: relative abundance estimate for the middle of the trend time
period (e.g. 2014 for a 2007-2021 trend).
\item \code{abd_ppy}: the median estimated percent per year change in relative
abundance.
\item \code{abd_ppy_lower/abd_ppy_upper}: the 80\% confidence interval for the
estimated percent per year change in relative abundance.
\item \code{abd_ppy_nonzero}: a logical (TRUE/FALSE) value indicating if the 80\%
confidence limits overlap zero (FALSE) or don't overlap zero (TRUE)
\item \code{abd_trend}: the median estimated cumulative change in relative
abundance over the trend time period.
\item \code{abd_trend_lower/abd_trend_upper}: the 80\% confidence interval for the
estimated cumulative change in relative abundance over the trend time
period.
}

If \code{fold_estimates = TRUE}, a data frame of fold-level trend estimates is
returned with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{species_code}: the alphanumeric eBird species code uniquely identifying
the species.
\item \code{season}:  season that the trend was estimated for: breeding,
nonbreeding, or resident.
\item \code{srd_id}: unique integer identifier for the grid cell.
\item \code{abd}: relative abundance estimate for the middle of the trend time
period (e.g. 2014 for a 2007-2021 trend).
\item \code{abd_ppy}: the estimated percent per year change in relative abundance.
}
}
\description{
Load the relative abundance trend estimates for a single species or a set of
species. Trends are estimated on a 27 km by 27 km grid for a single season
per species (breeding, non-breeding, or resident).  Note that data must be
download using \code{\link[=ebirdst_download_trends]{ebirdst_download_trends()}} prior to loading it using this
function.
}
\details{
The trends in relative abundance are estimated using a double machine
learning model. To quantify uncertainty, an ensemble of 100 estimates is made
at each location, each based on a random subsample of eBird data. The
estimated trend is the median across the ensemble, and the 80\% confidence
intervals are the lower 10th and upper 90th percentiles across the ensemble.
To access estimates from the individual folds making up the ensemble use
\code{fold_estimates = TRUE}. These fold-level estimates can be used to quantify
uncertainty, for example, when calculating the trend for a given region. For
further details on the methodology used to estimate trends consult Fink et
al. 2023.
