\arguments{
\item{species}{character; a single species given as a scientific name, common
name or six-letter species code (e.g. "woothr"). The full list of valid
species is in the \link{ebirdst_runs} data frame included in this package. To
download the example dataset, use \code{"yebsap-example"}.}

\item{path}{character; directory to download the data to. All downloaded
files will be placed in a sub-directory of this directory named for the
data version year, e.g. "2020" for the 2020 Status Data Products. Each
species' data package will then appear in a directory named with the eBird
species code. Defaults to a persistent data directory, which can be found
by calling \code{ebirdst_data_dir()}.}

\item{download_abundance}{whether to download estimates of abundance and
proportion of population.}

\item{download_occurrence}{logical; whether to download estimates of
occurrence.}

\item{download_count}{logical; whether to download estimates of count.}

\item{download_ranges}{logical; whether to download the range polygons.}

\item{download_regional}{logical; whether to download the regional summary
stats, e.g. percent of population in regions.}

\item{download_pis}{logical; whether to download spatial estimates of
predictor importance.}

\item{download_ppms}{logical; whether to download spatial predictive
performance metrics.}

\item{download_all}{logical; download all files in the data package.
Equivalent to setting all the \code{download_} arguments to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{pattern}{character; regular expression pattern to supply to
\link[stringr:str_detect]{str_detect()} to filter files to download. This
filter will be applied in addition to any of the \code{download_} arguments.
Note that some files are mandatory and will always be downloaded.}

\item{dry_run}{logical; whether to do a dry run, just listing files that will
be downloaded. This can be useful when testing the use of \code{pattern} to
filter the files to download.}

\item{force}{logical; if the data have already been downloaded, should a
fresh copy be downloaded anyway.}

\item{show_progress}{logical; whether to print download progress information.}
}
\value{
Path to the folder containing the downloaded data package for the
given species. If \code{dry_run = TRUE} a list of files to download will be
returned.
}
\description{
Download eBird Status Data Products for a single species, or for an example
species. Downloading Status & Trends data requires an access key, consult
\code{\link[=set_ebirdst_access_key]{set_ebirdst_access_key()}} for instructions on how to obtain and store this
key. The example data consist of the results for Yellow-bellied Sapsucker
subset to Michigan and are much smaller than the full dataset, making these
data quicker to download and process. Only the low resolution (27 km) data
are available for the example data. In addition, the example data are
accessible without an access key.
}
\details{
The complete data package for each species contains a large number
of files, all of which are cataloged in the vignettes. Most users will only
require a small subset of these files, so by default this function only
downloads the most commonly used files: GeoTIFFs providing estimate of
relative abundance and proportion of population. For those interested in
additional data products, the arguments starting with \code{download_} control
the download of these other products. The \code{pattern} argument provides even
finer grained control over what gets downloaded.

# download the example data
