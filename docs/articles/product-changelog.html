</h5>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: Checklists are included for January 1 2008 through December
31 2022, updated from January 1 2007 through December 31 2021.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Checklists up to 30 km in length are now included for
species that are run for the ocean only (e.g., Northern Gannet).</li>
<li>CHANGED: Checklists with duration less than 0.0167 hours (1 minute)
are dropped. These are primarily checklists with incorrect duration
information.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Checklist centroids derived from tracks are now calculated
using great circle distance, not sinusoidal distance.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The maximum allowable number of observers on a checklist is
50. All other checklists are dropped.</li>

<ul>
<li>ADDED: Rate (as kilometers per hour) has been added as an effort
covariate. Prediction is made to a value of 2 kmph, as the units for
duration is 1 hour and distance is 2 kilometers. For the range boundary
prediction, rate is set as the result of <code>effort_hrs</code> and
<code>effort_distance_km</code> having been maximized with partial
dependence values separately.</li>
<li>FIXED: Rainfall and Snowfall had a bug that resulted in them often
being all 0s, due to precision errors. This has been corrected and
tested.</li>
<li>CHANGED: CCI <strong>Summary:</strong> The main changes to the
calculation of CCI are in</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What kind of model is fit to checklist species richness using
predictive features, and</li>
<li>How deviations in model predictions are attributed to particular
observers and checklists.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Details</strong> The foundation of CCI is a predictive model
of checklist-level species richness (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>; i.e. number of species). In updating
CCI, changes were made to both the form of the predictive model of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and to the method that attributes
variation in richness to particular observers.</p>
<p>Prior to Version 2022, predictive features comprised weather,
landcover, habitat diversity, protocol, day of year, and variables that
are particular to the observer: observer_id and checklist_number (i.e.,
index of how many checklists a user has ever submitted from any stixel
to eBird; not to be confused with checklist_id). A mixed-effects
generalized additive model (GAM) was fit to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. This GAM used as predictive features
the natural log of <code>checklist_number</code>, a smooth spline of
<code>solar_noon_diff</code>, and the raw values of all other
predictors, with a random effect specification for
<code>observer_id</code> and <code>checklist_number</code>. The model
was used to make predictions <span class="math inline">\(p_{i}\)</span>
of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to data representing a
“standardized search”, in which all features except
<code>observer_id</code> and <code>checklist_number</code> were held
constant (at the column-wise mean) across observations. CCI was derived
from the variation in resulting predictions, and scaled to have mean 0
and variance 1.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
CCI_{i} = \\(pi - mean(p)\\) / sd(p)
\]</span></p>
<p>Version 2022 changed the functional form of the predictive model from
a (mostly) linear mixed-effects model to a random forest. Further, it
removed <code>observer_id</code> and <code>checklist_number</code> from
the suite of predictive features; the model is now blind to
person-specific effects. Instead, predictions to real data absent any
personal information establish conditional expectations of richness
given habitat, effort, weather, etc. Each expected value parameterizes a
Poisson distribution, which is used to compute the exceedance
probability of the actually-observed <code>S</code>, which is then
mapped to a standard-normal quantile. A GAM with a “factor smooth” basis
for <code>checklist_number</code> and <code>observer_id</code> is
applied to smooth the raw values for each observer. CCI currently
comprises these smoothed values.</p>

<h5 id="environmental-covariates">Environmental Covariates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#environmental-covariates"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: Covariate assignment now uses proper circular buffers for
neighborhood calculations (with 1.5 km radius) instead of the previously
used sinusoidal buffer, which had many locations of high skew across the
globe.</li>
<li>ADDED: Information about the moon has been added using two
covariates from the R suncalc package. Moon fraction represents the
fraction of the disk of the moon that was illuminated at a given time
and location and Moon altitude represents the altitude of the moon
(above or below the horizon, in radians) at a given location and
time.</li>
<li>ADDED: The <a href="https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/download" class="external-link">Joint Research
Center Global Surface Water</a> data has been added as yearly variables,
representing the binary presence of either seasonal or permanent water
(JRC/GSW1_4/YearlyHistory), calculated as percent land cover and edge
density within a neighborhood. This dataset is 30 m in spatial
resolution.</li>
<li>ADDED: Elevation data at 30 m resolution has been added from the <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/astgtmv003" class="external-link">ASTER Global Digital
Elevation Model</a>. This is represented as mean and standard deviation
within neighborhoods.</li>
<li>ADDED: MODIS 16-day Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) has been added
from <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13q1v061/" class="external-link">MOD13Q1</a>. This
has been summarized as mean and standard deviation within neighborhoods.
As this dataset is not available for water and has an artificial
boundary at the northern and southern latitudes based on availability of
light, we have added a boolean covariate <code>has_evi</code> that
describes whether the covariate was available at a given date and
location.</li>
<li>ADDED: Data describing shorelines from Sayre et al. 2021 has been
included. This includes means and standard deviations for: wave height,
tidal range, chlorophyll, turbidity, sinuosity, slope, and outflow
density; class densities (as km of coast per square km of area in
neighborhood) for for four classes of erodibility, and class densities
(as km of coast per square km of area in neighborhood) for 23 Ecological
Marine Units (EMUs) that describe the sea surface temperature, salinity,
and dissolved oxygen, as well as covariates describing the unique number
of erodibility and EMU classes in each neighborhood. As with EVI, we
have included a boolean <code>has_shoreline</code> covariate, as the
shoreline covariates are not spatially exhaustive, describing whether
the covariate was available at a given location.</li>
<li>UPDATED: MCD12Q1 LCCS land cover, land use, and hydrology data were
updated to version 6.1.</li>

</h4>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="base-model">Base Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#base-model"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: Both migrants and residents use circularized time as the
covariates for day of year, as sine and cosine of day normalized within
a stixel.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The binary presence/absence occurrence threshold at the
base model level now uses mccf1, replacing Cohen’s Kappa.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="prediction">Prediction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prediction"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: The calendar dates for grid prediction have changed as a
result of converting the prediction values to integers (formerly they
included fractional day information).</li>
<li>CHANGED: The prediction values for both
<code>effort_distance_km</code> and <code>effort_hrs</code> are set to
their 90th quantiles when making predictions to determine the range
boundary. Previously these were chosen to maximize the partial
dependence (PD) curve.<br>
</li>
<li>CHANGED: The prediction values for CCI and time of day
(<code>solar_noon_diff</code>) are now chosen to maximize the abundance
partial dependence (PD) constrained to values where the species was
detected. Previously they were chosen using the occurrence partial
dependence curve and were not constrained to detections. -CHANGED: When
maximizing the prediction value for CCI at a stixel level, the allowable
range of values is now 0-2, up from 0-1.85, based on the range of the
new version of CCI values overall.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The prediction value for <code>effort_distance_km</code> is
now 2 km, to more closely reflect the distribution of checklists and to
increase overall signal.</li>
<li>CHANGED: weather optimization arise now done for relative abundance,
not occurrence.</li>
<li>CHANGED: PD maximization of solar_noon_diff allows the full range of
quantiles to allow selection of the highest and lowest quantile values
which are often nocturnal. Previously the outermost quantile values were
not allowed for selection.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="ensemble">Ensemble<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ensemble"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: With the replacement of the base model binary
presence/absence occurrence threshold with MCC-F1, the ensemble level
percent above threshold (PAT) cutoff value has been fixed at 0.14
(interpreted as a species being found at least once a week).</li>
<li>ADDED: In the ensemble support calculation, a new product has been
added, spatial coverage. This represents the fraction of 3 km grid
cell-weeks that have checklists within a given stixel, averaged across
the ensemble (essentially a spatial smooth. This weekly layer is then
used to mask all predictions from all species values where the spatial
coverage value is below 0.00025. This helps control extrapolation in
places like Russia and central Africa.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The ensemble support site selection probability is now 0
for unsampled islands.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The ensemble support-based site selection probability mask
has been changed to 0.0025. Ocean run species no longer use the site
selection probability mask.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="data-products">Data Products<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-products"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>UPDATED: The prediction definition is now: the {occurrence, count,
or relative abundance} of individuals of a given species detected by an
expert eBirder on a 1 hour, 2 kilometer traveling checklist at the
optimal time of day. Predictions have been optimized for user skill,
hourly weather and moon conditions, specific for the given region,
season, and species, in order to maximize detection rates.</li>
<li>REMOVED: Partial dependence values are no longer calculated or
distributed.</li>

<ul>
<li>ADDED: New and modified Status covariates have been added to the
trends model. New covariates include speed (distance / duration), moon
fraction and altitude, shoreline, and 30 m elevation.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Water cover is now represented by the static <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/astwbdv001/" class="external-link">ASTER water bodies
dataset</a> instead of the annual <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod44wv006/" class="external-link">MODIS MOD44W

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="ensemble-1">Ensemble<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ensemble-1"></a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: The residual confounding adjustment is now a
spatially​explicit adjustment, calculated and applied separately for each
pixel. Regions, Years, and Seasons</li>
<li>CHANGED: Trends regions now have variable start years, with all
trends now being run for a shorter time series, to ensure all years in
the time series have sufficient data to model trends. For example, North
American trends will now start in 2012 rather than 2007.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Seasonal dates for Trends are now identical to Status
seasonal dates.</li>
<li>CHANGED: For species with trends estimated for a season crossing the
year end (e.g. December to January), the time series will be shifted
back by one year to ensure the same number of years for the trend for
all species in a given region. For example, a North American breeding
trend (e.g. May to June) will be for 2012 to 2022, while a non-breeding
trend (e.g. December to January) will be for 2011/12 to 2021/22.</li>

<ul>
<li>CHANGED: The adaptive partitioning algorithm (AdaSTEM) now grid
samples the training data before stixels are defined.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The projection initialization of each stixel iteration is
now fully randomized, previously it was constrained to keep boundaries
in the ocean.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Stixels are now allowed to recurse one size smaller, to
approximately 90km on a side, and remain one size larger (3000km on a
side), except for resident-specific stixels where the maximum remains
1500km on a side, for computational reasons.</li>
<li>CHANGED: There is now a separate AdaSTEM partitioning for residents
that uses the full year of data instead of a 28 day window. The training
data for these partitions are also grid sampled before definition. The
stixel parameters are set to have a maximum of 65,000 checklists per
stixel over the full year, after grid sampling, and a minimum of 6,500
checklists per stixel (e.g., stixels are not allowed to be subdivided if
they contain less than this amount).</li>

<h4 id="model-ensemble">Model Ensemble<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-ensemble"></a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: Models are now run for 200 replicates (folds).</li>
<li>CHANGED: The percent above threshold (PAT) cutoff has been replaced
with a data-driven maximization of the MCC-F1 curve (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11278" class="external-link uri">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11278</a>), constrained between
0.05 and 0.25. The training data are grid sampled before optimizing
using the MCC-F1 curve and 25 realizations are done before taking the
median PAT value. For migrants, this is done weekly, for residents
across the whole year.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The process for selecting the ensemble support cutoff or
threshold (the number of models required to show predictions) has been
updated to have the training data grid sampled first, then optimized for
a true positive rate of 99%, with the cutoff constrained between 0.5 and
0.9. For migrants, this is done weekly, for residents across the whole
year. This process is done 25 times and then a median threshold value is
selected.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The site selection probability layer has been significantly
improved. In the binary classification model, prediction grid locations
that are &gt;= 50% overlapped by a 1.5km buffer of checklist locations
have been removed. This resolves the previous, erroneously low values in

<ul>
<li>CHANGED: The grid sample method now retains all unique values of
factor variables (e.g., island).</li>
<li>CHANGED: The grid sampler oversamples detections to achieve 25%
detection probability in the training dataset. Previously the grid
sampler would often overshoot the 25% target and excessively duplicate
detections. This has been corrected so that oversampling never yields
detection probabilities greater than 25% and detections are duplicated
at most 25 times.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Mean spatial coverage of each stixel is now correctly
estimated as the proportion of 3 km pixels that contain checklists.</li>

<li>CHANGED: Along with a resident-specific AdaSTEM partitioning,
resident models now predict all weeks of the year in a single stixel.
Previously, resident models used data from the whole year for training,
but only predicted the four weeks in a stixel, similar to the way
migrants are modeled.</li>

<ul>
<li>CHANGED: The occurrence model prediction values for effort variables
are now set at 1 hour and 1 kilometer. Previously, the effort variable
values used for the occurrence model prediction were the same as those
used for the occurrence model, which sought to maximize detection by
optimizing the distance and duration effort variables to capture as much
signal as possible, up to 12 hours (6 hours in this version) and 10
kilometers. These prediction values are retained for the
presence/absence estimation.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The prediction value for Checklist Calibration Index (CCI)
is now maximized within each stixel using the partial dependencies.
Previously, the value for was set at a fixed value of 1.85 for all
species and stixels.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Partial dependencies are now only generated for the first
50 folds, to reduce computational cost.</li>
<li>CHANGED: To show “year-round” on a seasonal map now requires only
0.1% overlap between breeding and non-breeding seasons. Previously, all
four seasons and an overlap of greater than 5% was required.</li>

Icosahedron Gnomic projection that generates partitions with largely
conformal stixel boundaries across the globe.</li>

for species with strong spatiotemporal stationarity. These include the
following:
<ul>
<li>Each stixel loads the full year of training and test data, not just
the 28 day window associated with the given stixel.</li>
<li>The DAY predictor is encoding cyclically using sin and cosin
transformation to allow the model to wrap the year.</li>
<li>The spatiotemporal grid sampling now seeks a maximum sample size of
65,000 checklists in a given stixel (for migrants this value is
5,000).</li>

<h4 id="data-products-3">Data Products<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-products-3"></a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: The count model prediction values for effort variables are
now set at 1 hour and 1 kilometer. Previously, the effort variables used
for the count model prediction were the same as those used for the
occurrence model, which sought to maximize detection by optimizing the
distance and duration effort variables to capture as much signal as
possible, up to 12 hours (6 hours in this version) and 10
kilometers.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Zeroes in data products that are outside of the prediction
area for species (also known as assumed zeroes) now require, on average,
across the up-to 100 models in the ensemble, 0.5% of 3km grid cells
filled with at least 1 checklist for a given week to be reported as
zero. Previously, this was 0.1% of 3km grid cells. This has been
adjusted to offer a more appropriately conservative representation of
where absence can be assumed based on overall data volume.</li>
<li>ADDED: Locations (3km grid cells) with less than a 0.5% mean site
selection probability are now masked out of the final data products and
reported as NA. Mean site selection probability is calculated weekly in
a species-agnostic AdaSTEM workflow that estimates the probability that
a location of a given habitat configuration will be visited in a given
region and season.</li>
<li>ADDED: Spatial representations of predictive performance metrics and
other individual model-level summaries are being generated as 27km
GeoTIFFs for each week of the year. The spatialization is done by
assigning the stixel-level values to every 27km grid cell within the
stixel and then averaging across stixels to determine regional
metrics.</li>
<li>FIXED: The Caspian Sea is now masked out of all data products.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Raw test data that does not receive model predictions has
been removed from the calculation of predictive performance metrics.
Previously, this type of test data was used as a form of assumed absence
in the calculation of binary predictive performance metrics.</li>
<li>ADDED: Predictions to 3km grid cells now include a standardization
of hourly weather within each individual model. The hourly weather
values set for prediction are based on a maximization of occurrence
estimates between the 80th and 90th percentiles.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Calculation of individual model partial dependencies now
uses train out of bag data. Previously, train in bag data was used.</li>
<li>ADDED: Predictor Importance and Partial Dependency products are now
included for both occurrence rate and count models. Previously, these
products were only available for the occurrence rate model.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The time covariate used in the models, calculated as the
difference between the local checklist time and solar noon at the
checklist location, has been changed to use the temporal midpoint of the
checklist for the calculation. Previously, the time at the start of the
checklist had been used for this calculation.</li>
<li>FIXED: The temporal centroid of individual models, used with
predictor importance and partial dependencies, has been changed to
represent the mean date of train in bag data. Previously, this was a
mean of all train, test, and all four weeks of 3km grid cell location
data.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Regional habitat association charts are based on a weighted
summary of stixel-level predictor importance and partial dependence
estimates, with the weighting determined by the proportion of the region
covered by each stixel. Previously, stixel centroids were used to
determine the set of stixels contributing to a given region, with crude
approximations of the stixels as rectangles in lat-lon coordinates being
used to determine the overlap-based weighting. Now, the exact stixel
shape is used when calculating regional habitat associations, by
considering the exact set of 27km grid cells falling within each stixel,
to determine both the set of stixels used in habitat summarization and
the overlap-based weighting for a given region.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Habitat and regional abundance and range statistical
summaries are now computed for all species, globally, using the <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-1-states-provinces/" class="external-link">Natural
