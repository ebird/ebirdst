<h5 id="base-model">Base Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#base-model"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: The MCC-F1 thresholding that was applied to the occurrence
rate model to determine presence/absence (binary) estimates has been
replaced with a separate binary classification model. This model is
extremely similar to the occurrence rate model, but instead of
estimating probability of occurrence on a scale of 0-1, this version of
random forest predicts a binary 0 or 1 for each prediction (checklist or
prediction grid cell). Our implementation of this model uses the same
feature set, factor handling, and balanced sampling as the occurrence
rate model in operation. Switching from a stixel-wide (covering four
weeks and all locations) presence/absence threshold to checklist- and-
prediction-specific estimates of presence/absence greatly improved the
stability of estimates through space and time, especially migration
timing, and dramatically simplified the calculation and interpretation
of range boundary estimates. Further, the response of expert reviewers
to the quality of the map predictions with the new binary classification
model was much better than for previous versions. This change resulted
in a number of smaller, downstream changes:
<ul>
<li>Previously, when making range boundary presence/absence estimates on
the prediction grid, we predicted to a separate set of maximized effort
values (as opposed to the prediction unit of 1 hour and 2 kilometers for
occurrence rate, count, and relative abundance) to extract as much range
boundary signal as possible. This was removed and range boundary
presence/absence estimates are now for the standard prediction units of
1 hour and 2 kilometers.</li>
<li>Previously, when grid sampling the checklist data in each stixel for
each species, we oversampled species detections if the detection
probability fell below 25%. In applying the binary classification model,
we found that doing this led to overfitting, by providing too much
duplicated signal through oversampling, and that it degraded predictive
performance. As a result, oversampling of detections was excluded from
the binary classification model and has been removed from the occurrence
rate model.</li>
<li>Previously, at the ensemble level, the prediction grid cell-level
calculation of the range boundary was done by taking an average of the
number of occurrence rate estimates in the ensemble that were greater
than the stixel-level local mccf1 threshold and comparing that to an
arbitrarily set value of 0.14 (1 out of seven, or theoretically once in
a week) across the ensemble. This value was sometimes lowered by expert
reviewers, especially for cryptic species, to improve the range
boundary. Now that threshold is set at 0.5 for all species, such that
estimated presence means that the binary classification model predicted
the species to be present at a given location more than half of the
time. Expert reviewers can no longer change this value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FIXED: We discovered a <a href="https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger/issues/733" class="external-link">bug</a> in the R
<code>ranger</code> package which is used for the base models, relating
to how features were sorted and sampled in the trees. In the count
model, for approximately 20-30% of stixels this bug caused features,
most often the predicted occurrence, which is a feature in the count
model, to be randomly excluded from tree building even when we specified
that these features must be included. The bug was fixed by the package
author, but we continued to encounter this issue in ~5% of stixels in
the version of <code>ranger</code> distributed by CRAN, so we have
maintained a branch of the package which fully fixes this issue.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The “hurdle” model was removed and the count model now
includes only checklists with observed counts greater than zero, as
opposed to previously including checklists with observed counts greater
than zero as well as checklists predicted to be present by the
occurrence rate model and <code>mccf1</code> threshold and having a
count of zero. After fixing the above bug and implementing the new
binary classification model, we discovered a significant decline in the
quality of the count and relative abundance estimates, as seen in
predictive performance metrics (PPMs), particularly the Poisson deviance
for the count and relative abundance estimates. This was attributed to
an increase in checklists in which species were predicted to be present
but with an observed count of zero entering the count model, as result
of adding the binary classification model and potentially exacerbated by
all count models seeing all features after the bugfix. The solution was
to remove the “hurdle” and exclude checklists predicted to be present
but having observed counts of zero and only include checklists with
non-zero observed counts in the count model. This resulted in a
substantial improvement in the PPMs for the count and relative abundance
estimates, especially the Poisson deviance measure, across a set of 20
test species at their full spatiotemporal extent. This change also means
that the relative abundance values themselves are much higher than in
previous versions.</li>
<li>CHANGED: To improve computational performance and simplify feature
sets, we now drop all features in a stixel that have the same value, as
random forest effectively ignores these features in fitting models.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="prediction">Prediction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prediction"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: We have transitioned to a new 3 km X 3 km prediction grid
in the widely used <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2018.1504949" class="external-link">Equal Earth equal
area projection</a>. Previously the predictions were made to a 2.96 km X
2.96 km prediction grid using a non-standard sinusoidal projection.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="ensemble">Ensemble<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ensemble"></a>
</h5>
<ul>
<li>Land and Ocean
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: At a high level, the workflow has been changed to be run
land-only (making predictions to only land grid cells and only including
checklists up to 10km in length anywhere) or land-and-ocean (making
predictions to all locations and including checklists up to 30km in
length at locations that are over 50% ocean). This includes a number of
changes to the stixel design, data coverage, and resulting masking rules
described below. This was done to more fully represent species with
at-sea distributions and significant land and sea distributions (e.g.,
Phalaropes, Jaegers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stixels
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: The maximum allowable stixel size has been reduced from
3000km on a side to 1600km on side, due to computational constraints and
the previous size generating too much extrapolation.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The number of stixel iterations run for each species has
been reduced from 200 to 100.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The minimum number of checklists in a stixel has been
increased from 500 to 1000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CHANGED: Stixels are generated separately for both land-only and
land-and-ocean workflow runs. In land-only stixel generation, the rules
allow subdividing coastal stixels, even when this would produce small
ocean stixels with too few checklists to model, because ocean stixels
are not included in these runs. For land-and-ocean stixels, this
distinction is not made, allowing large coastal stixels. Additionally,
the set of checklists considered by each run differs as mentioned above:
land-and-ocean stixel generation includes checklists with travel
distances of up to 30km that cover more than 50% ocean.</li>
<li>Data Coverage and Masking
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: All species’ results are masked by two predictions
generated from separate “data coverage” workflows (run separately for
land-only and land-and-ocean): a) weekly estimates of site selection
probability (0-1; the probability a grid cell of a certain habitat
configuration receiving a checklist in a region and season), and b)
spatial coverage (0-1; the regional-seasonal fraction of 3km grid cells
that received checklists in a given week). These are used to mask out
species predictions from locations with very low values of these
estimates, to control extrapolation in areas with insufficient coverage
(both spatially and habitat-specific). Land-only and land-and-ocean
workflows have slightly different cutoffs and application of these
values (see below). Finally, the spatial coverage values are used to add
“assumed zeroes” or areas where there was sufficient data coverage to
assume that a species was likely not present without running models
(this is the difference between “Modeled Area” and “No prediction” on
the maps).</li>

<ul>
<li>FIXED: Previously, spatial coverage for the land-only workflow
incorrectly included grid cells over water in the calculation of spatial
coverage, resulting in incorrectly low values below the threshold in
areas with small amounts of land and large amounts of water (e.g.,
French Polynesia). Subsequently, these areas were masked out, despite
having sufficient spatial coverage over land. Now, spatial coverage for
the land-only workflow only considers grid cells over land in the
spatial coverage calculation, and both land and ocean for the
land-and-ocean calculation.</li>
<li>Ensemble-level Range Boundaries
<ul>
<li>Ensemble-level range-wide boundaries are defined by using the
information on how many models for each species, across an ensemble with
100 members, made predictions at each prediction grid cell. We call this
“ensemble support.” Range-wide boundaries are set on a weekly basis by
choosing the highest value of ensemble support, or number of models
making predictions, represented as a percent (e.g., 50 out of 100 models
reporting is 50%) that maintains a true positive rate of 99.5% among
grid sampled species detections for the given week, constrained to be
between 50% and 95% ensemble support.
<ul>
<li>This year, “ensemble support” has been calculated separately from
the species base models by counting how many models would have had
sufficient data to run the species base models. The requirements for
sufficient data to run the species models within a stixel were: a) at
least 10 species detections, and b) 50 checklists overall after grid
sampling. This has been done across a larger number of stixel
iterations, without running the actual base models on all iterations.
This allowed decreasing the number of base mode; stixel iterations from
200 to 100 while increasing the number of stixel iterations used by
ensemble support from 200 to 400. Overall this led to a significant
computational cost reduction as well as higher quality ensemble support
range boundaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CHANGED: The minimum ensemble-level range boundary threshold has
been increased from 50% to 75% of models reporting estimates, with an
unchanged maximum value of 95%, to control extrapolation. However,
expert map reviewers can override this (only for all weeks of the year)
in the review process to be 50%, 90%, 95% or 99%, to further control
extrapolation or omission, if needed. Confidence intervals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CHANGED: The method for the summarization of confidence intervals
for occurrence, count, and relative abundance estimates has been changed
from <a href="https://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/5601/notes/sub.pdf" class="external-link">Geyer
subsampling</a> to simple 90th and 10th quantiles.</li>

<li>What kind of model is fit to checklist species richness using
predictive features, and</li>
<li>How deviations in model predictions are attributed to particular
observers and checklists.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Details</strong> The foundation of CCI is a predictive model
of checklist-level species richness
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>S</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math>;
i.e. number of species). In updating CCI, changes were made to both the
form of the predictive model of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>S</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math>
and to the method that attributes variation in richness to particular
observers.</p>
<p>Prior to Version 2022, predictive features comprised weather,
landcover, habitat diversity, protocol, day of year, and variables that
are particular to the observer: observer_id and checklist_number (i.e.,
index of how many checklists a user has ever submitted from any stixel
to eBird; not to be confused with checklist_id). A mixed-effects
generalized additive model (GAM) was fit to
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>S</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math>.
This GAM used as predictive features the natural log of
<code>checklist_number</code>, a smooth spline of
<code>solar_noon_diff</code>, and the raw values of all other
predictors, with a random effect specification for
<code>observer_id</code> and <code>checklist_number</code>. The model
was used to make predictions
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>p</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p_{i}</annotation></semantics></math>
of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>S</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math>
to data representing a “standardized search”, in which all features
except <code>observer_id</code> and <code>checklist_number</code> were
held constant (at the column-wise mean) across observations. CCI was
derived from the variation in resulting predictions, and scaled to have
mean 0 and variance 1.</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$
CCI_{i} = \\(pi - mean(p)\\) / sd(p)
$$</span></p>
<p>Version 2022 changed the functional form of the predictive model from
a (mostly) linear mixed-effects model to a random forest. Further, it
removed <code>observer_id</code> and <code>checklist_number</code> from
the suite of predictive features; the model is now blind to
person-specific effects. Instead, predictions to real data absent any
personal information establish conditional expectations of richness
given habitat, effort, weather, etc. Each expected value parameterizes a
Poisson distribution, which is used to compute the exceedance
probability of the actually-observed <code>S</code>, which is then
mapped to a standard-normal quantile. A GAM with a “factor smooth” basis
for <code>checklist_number</code> and <code>observer_id</code> is
applied to smooth the raw values for each observer. CCI currently
comprises these smoothed values.</p>

</h5>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: Covariate assignment now uses proper circular buffers for
neighborhood calculations (with 1.5 km radius) instead of the previously
used sinusoidal buffer, which had many locations of high skew across the
globe.</li>
<li>ADDED: Information about the moon has been added using two
covariates from the R suncalc package. Moon fraction represents the
fraction of the disk of the moon that was illuminated at a given time
and location and Moon altitude represents the altitude of the moon
(above or below the horizon, in radians) at a given location and
time.</li>
<li>ADDED: The <a href="https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/" class="external-link">Joint
Research Center Global Surface Water</a> data has been added as yearly
variables, representing the binary presence of either seasonal or
permanent water (JRC/GSW1_4/YearlyHistory), calculated as percent land
cover and edge density within a neighborhood. This dataset is 30 m in
spatial resolution.</li>
<li>ADDED: Elevation data at 30 m resolution has been added from the <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/astgtmv003" class="external-link">ASTER Global Digital
Elevation Model</a>. This is represented as mean and standard deviation
within neighborhoods.</li>
<li>ADDED: MODIS 16-day Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) has been added
from <a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13q1v061/" class="external-link">MOD13Q1</a>. This
has been summarized as mean and standard deviation within neighborhoods.
As this dataset is not available for water and has an artificial
boundary at the northern and southern latitudes based on availability of
light, we have added a boolean covariate <code>has_evi</code> that
describes whether the covariate was available at a given date and
location.</li>
<li>ADDED: Data describing shorelines from Sayre et al. 2021 has been
included. This includes means and standard deviations for: wave height,
tidal range, chlorophyll, turbidity, sinuosity, slope, and outflow
density; class densities (as km of coast per square km of area in
neighborhood) for for four classes of erodibility, and class densities
(as km of coast per square km of area in neighborhood) for 23 Ecological
Marine Units (EMUs) that describe the sea surface temperature, salinity,
and dissolved oxygen, as well as covariates describing the unique number
of erodibility and EMU classes in each neighborhood. As with EVI, we
have included a boolean <code>has_shoreline</code> covariate, as the
shoreline covariates are not spatially exhaustive, describing whether
the covariate was available at a given location.</li>
<li>UPDATED: MCD12Q1 LCCS land cover, land use, and hydrology data were
updated to version 6.1.</li>

included fractional day information).</li>
<li>CHANGED: The prediction values for both
<code>effort_distance_km</code> and <code>effort_hrs</code> are set to
their 90th quantiles when making predictions to determine the range
boundary. Previously these were chosen to maximize the partial
dependence (PD) curve.<br>
</li>
<li>CHANGED: The prediction values for CCI and time of day
(<code>solar_noon_diff</code>) are now chosen to maximize the abundance
partial dependence (PD) constrained to values where the species was
detected. Previously they were chosen using the occurrence partial
dependence curve and were not constrained to detections.</li>
<li>CHANGED: When maximizing the prediction value for CCI at a stixel
level, the allowable range of values is now 0-2, up from 0-1.85, based
on the range of the new version of CCI values overall.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The prediction value for <code>effort_distance_km</code> is
now 2 km, to more closely reflect the distribution of checklists and to
increase overall signal.</li>
<li>CHANGED: weather optimization arise now done for relative abundance,
not occurrence.</li>
<li>CHANGED: PD maximization of solar_noon_diff allows the full range of

presence/absence occurrence threshold with MCC-F1, the ensemble level
percent above threshold (PAT) cutoff value has been fixed at 0.14
(interpreted as a species being found at least once a week).</li>
<li>ADDED: In the ensemble support calculation, a new product has been
added, spatial coverage. This represents the fraction of 3 km grid
cell-weeks that have checklists within a given stixel, averaged across
the ensemble (essentially a spatial smooth. This weekly layer is then
used to mask all predictions from all species values where the spatial
coverage value is below 0.00025. This helps control extrapolation in
places like Russia and central Africa.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The ensemble support site selection probability is now 0
for unsampled islands.</li>

samples the training data before stixels are defined.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The projection initialization of each stixel iteration is
now fully randomized, previously it was constrained to keep boundaries
in the ocean.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Stixels are now allowed to recurse one size smaller, to
approximately 90km on a side, and remain one size larger (3000km on a
side), except for resident-specific stixels where the maximum remains
1500km on a side, for computational reasons.</li>
<li>CHANGED: There is now a separate AdaSTEM partitioning for residents
that uses the full year of data instead of a 28 day window. The training
data for these partitions are also grid sampled before definition. The
stixel parameters are set to have a maximum of 65,000 checklists per
stixel over the full year, after grid sampling, and a minimum of 6,500
checklists per stixel (e.g., stixels are not allowed to be subdivided if

<ul>
<li>CHANGED: Models are now run for 200 replicates (folds).</li>
<li>CHANGED: The percent above threshold (PAT) cutoff has been replaced
with a data-driven maximization of the MCC-F1 curve (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11278" class="external-link uri">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11278</a>), constrained between
0.05 and 0.25. The training data are grid sampled before optimizing
using the MCC-F1 curve and 25 realizations are done before taking the
median PAT value. For migrants, this is done weekly, for residents
across the whole year.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The process for selecting the ensemble support cutoff or
threshold (the number of models required to show predictions) has been
updated to have the training data grid sampled first, then optimized for
a true positive rate of 99%, with the cutoff constrained between 0.5 and
0.9. For migrants, this is done weekly, for residents across the whole
year. This process is done 25 times and then a median threshold value is
selected.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The site selection probability layer has been significantly
improved. In the binary classification model, prediction grid locations
that are &gt;= 50% overlapped by a 1.5km buffer of checklist locations
have been removed. This resolves the previous, erroneously low values in
dense, urban areas and more accurately reflects the true probability of
site selection in these areas. This change only impacts species
estimates in places with a site selection probability value of less than
0.5%, where species estimates are masked.</li>

<li>CHANGED: The grid sampler oversamples detections to achieve 25%
detection probability in the training dataset. Previously the grid
sampler would often overshoot the 25% target and excessively duplicate
detections. This has been corrected so that oversampling never yields
detection probabilities greater than 25% and detections are duplicated

values used for the occurrence model prediction were the same as those

optimizing the distance and duration effort variables to capture as much
signal as possible, up to 12 hours (6 hours in this version) and 10
kilometers. These prediction values are retained for the
presence/absence estimation.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The prediction value for Checklist Calibration Index (CCI)
is now maximized within each stixel using the partial dependencies.
Previously, the value for was set at a fixed value of 1.85 for all

<li>CHANGED: The count model prediction values for effort variables are
now set at 1 hour and 1 kilometer. Previously, the effort variables used
for the count model prediction were the same as those used for the
occurrence model, which sought to maximize detection by optimizing the
distance and duration effort variables to capture as much signal as
possible, up to 12 hours (6 hours in this version) and 10
kilometers.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Zeroes in data products that are outside of the prediction
area for species (also known as assumed zeroes) now require, on average,
across the up-to 100 models in the ensemble, 0.5% of 3km grid cells
filled with at least 1 checklist for a given week to be reported as
zero. Previously, this was 0.1% of 3km grid cells. This has been
adjusted to offer a more appropriately conservative representation of
where absence can be assumed based on overall data volume.</li>
<li>ADDED: Locations (3km grid cells) with less than a 0.5% mean site
selection probability are now masked out of the final data products and
reported as NA. Mean site selection probability is calculated weekly in
a species-agnostic AdaSTEM workflow that estimates the probability that
a location of a given habitat configuration will be visited in a given
region and season.</li>
<li>ADDED: Spatial representations of predictive performance metrics and
other individual model-level summaries are being generated as 27km
GeoTIFFs for each week of the year. The spatialization is done by
assigning the stixel-level values to every 27km grid cell within the
stixel and then averaging across stixels to determine regional
metrics.</li>
<li>FIXED: The Caspian Sea is now masked out of all data products.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Raw test data that does not receive model predictions has
been removed from the calculation of predictive performance metrics.
Previously, this type of test data was used as a form of assumed absence
in the calculation of binary predictive performance metrics.</li>
<li>ADDED: Predictions to 3km grid cells now include a standardization
of hourly weather within each individual model. The hourly weather
values set for prediction are based on a maximization of occurrence
estimates between the 80th and 90th percentiles.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Calculation of individual model partial dependencies now
uses train out of bag data. Previously, train in bag data was used.</li>
<li>ADDED: Predictor Importance and Partial Dependency products are now
included for both occurrence rate and count models. Previously, these
products were only available for the occurrence rate model.</li>
<li>CHANGED: The time covariate used in the models, calculated as the
difference between the local checklist time and solar noon at the
checklist location, has been changed to use the temporal midpoint of the
checklist for the calculation. Previously, the time at the start of the
checklist had been used for this calculation.</li>
<li>FIXED: The temporal centroid of individual models, used with
predictor importance and partial dependencies, has been changed to
represent the mean date of train in bag data. Previously, this was a
mean of all train, test, and all four weeks of 3km grid cell location
data.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Regional habitat association charts are based on a weighted
summary of stixel-level predictor importance and partial dependence
estimates, with the weighting determined by the proportion of the region
covered by each stixel. Previously, stixel centroids were used to
determine the set of stixels contributing to a given region, with crude
approximations of the stixels as rectangles in lat-lon coordinates being
used to determine the overlap-based weighting. Now, the exact stixel
shape is used when calculating regional habitat associations, by
considering the exact set of 27km grid cells falling within each stixel,
to determine both the set of stixels used in habitat summarization and
the overlap-based weighting for a given region.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Habitat and regional abundance and range statistical
summaries are now computed for all species, globally, using the <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-1-states-provinces/" class="external-link">Natural
Earth Data Admin 1 data</a> for summarization.</li>

<ul>
<li>CHANGED: The adaptive partitioning algorithm (AdaSTEM) now uses
projected coordinates (sinusoidal) and meters instead of unprojected
coordinates and degrees.</li>
<li>CHANGED: AdaSTEM partitions are now 1500 kilometers on a side at
their largest and 187 kilometers on a side at their smallest.</li>
<li>CHANGED: AdaSTEM rules now split partitions if they contain more
than 16,000 checklists or are larger than 1500 kilometers on a

<li>CHANGED: AdaSTEM now reverts individual partitions back to the next
largest size if any of the partition children contain less than 500
checklists and are not mostly open water. Partitions are never allowed
to revert back to partitions that are 1500 kilometers or more on a

<li>ADDED: Individual models now report 0 for predictions if the
training data set contains less than 10 positive observations of a
species and the mean spatial coverage within the model is greater than
or equal to 5%.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Range boundaries are now set weekly to have the highest
level of ensemble support, between 50% and 95% of models, while
including at least 99.5% of positive observations, changed from being
fixed at 75% of models in previous versions.</li>
<li>CHANGED: Zeroes in data products that are outside of the prediction
area for species (also known as assumed zeroes) are now based on the
mean spatial coverage of checklists within those areas. For locations
where species-specific models did not report zero or non-zero
predictions, locations need to have, on average, across the up-to 100
models in the ensemble, 0.1% of 3km grid cells filled with at least 1
checklist for a given week to be reported as zero. Previously, these
locations required 95% of models at a given location to have had at
least 50 complete checklists for the given week.</li>
